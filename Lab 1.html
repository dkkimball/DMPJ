My hobby is stock dog trialing.  I have two border collies that I compete with, Bert who is 
old and wise(i.e. he is smarter than me,) and Henry who is young and exuberant(i.e. he doesn't 
listen to me!) In the summer we travel around Colorado to dog trials where we compete against 
hundreds of other handlers and dogs.  While we love to compete our favorite part of any trial is 
setting out the sheep for other competitors.  This requires us to take the sheep to a designated 
spot where the dog competing will come and gather them and then take them through the set course. 
Every trial is a fantasic get together as handlers and dogs come from all around the world,   
and you never know what new friends you will meet!
